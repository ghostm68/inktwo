I kissed her, a long hard lip-lock. Because Chloe didn't know it, but Kim Jong Nam was gone, and in a way I couldn't have loved her more. "Well, now, Chloe," I said, "you've got your concert panties in an uproar and all over nothing. I was thinking about the dog problem. "I've got some dogs. I can get some more. A lot of them." "Yeah?" "I can, inky. I know I can! the studio's crazy about me and dumb as hell. I'll bet if they  thought I was going to show tits, he--"   "Who?" I said. "Who are you talking about, chloe?"

"Mr Moneybags. You know who he is, don't you?" "Yeah," I said. "Yeah, I know the moneybags right well. How do you figure on taking them down?"

We talked it over, lying there on her bed together, and off in the night somewhere the howling voice of ruby seemed to whisper to forget it, forget it, inky, it's not too late if you stop now. You can leave and take me with you so i never have to see any cages again. And I did try, God knows I tried. But right after that, right after the voice, her hand gripped one of mine and kneaded it between her thighs; and she moaned and shivered and so I didn't forget.

"Well," I said, after a time, "I suppose we can work it out. The way I see it is, if at first you don't canine, bark, and bark again." "oh, darling?" "In other words," I said, "where there's a puppy there's a way." She moaned a little, and then she squirted. "Oh, inky, you're as cute as ruby ! I think I will put you both in the same room!" I could hear Ruby's yelp, Satan get thee behind me. But right after that, right after the yelp, her hand gripped mine again but not to let go this time; and she held me so that the dog's howl drifted away through the unlocked door where memories go to become distant and so I kissed her again.
a long and intense peck.

                         SEQUENCE "A" 
  A-l   START                          the picture with the actual airport sign:
          KLIA, set in a neon yellow glow.
          In the corridors burning colors, signs and signals,
          stray travelers and unattended luggage.  It is early
          morning.
          Now the CAMERA leaves the sign and MOVES ACROSS, the
          grey asphalt of the entrance filling the screen.  As
          speed accelerates to a breezy flight level, traffic signs, white arrows, 
          limit warnings,    taxis, etc., flash by.  SUPERIMPOSED on all

                                                             whole truth...        

BRIM 122 going back for a billy shakes coup de soliloquy won't keep you updated on the slang, fmg is not strictly the obliteration operation but also fresh money gangsters or moreover fuck me good...
it's that i really love cats and that kitten well gosh rally cat forever! fine, but let's get back to some sort of narrative. sure; Not everything wroted by a writer is in fact created from within. I can, for example envision the ghost of Caravaggio guiding the lyrics to Pink Floyd; you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking... The sun sizzled soon after dawn alike a testicle frying in extra virgin olive oil.  White supremacy is all we've ever knowed with the possible exception of motown. Still, I wonder why they were calling it a white nationalist gathering.  White Nationalism...Weird, wasn't it alt right recently...I shut the windows hoping to avoid the sun's heat as it was hot enough with the steamy lover holding half my bed hostage. I didn't want to think of anything but her, but this charlottesville virginia story was seeping in from every cell phone i owned.  i had just been through parts of the states and aside from the quirks it all felt so wonderful uhm it was akin to the fake feeling of hope we all had after the 2008 election before the rug got pulled out from under us except this time round most people seemed agreed that the donald could and would take the feeling and make it real. great again how groovy would that be and i mean for the so called many sides...problem is obviously even if we should not all of us want the same things as was underlined by some copycat driver taking his cue from that new terror tactic of vehicle...On the airplane I thought about the anniversary of tate labianca crimes and that phrase saying the race wars are coming...as my lover smiled at me through the darkness, it hit me; we've not yet escaped the sixties...pink pussy hats! russia! kenya! belarus! venezuela! accoring to the washington post, trump sounds at times just like lyndon b in terms of tactics, it's a neat theory until you take a walk downtown and realize that on the streets it's mostly fresh money gangsters and fuck me good people. I say to no one in particular it's patently clear that more than a few of the white nationalists are not white and right they are for how else are they going to get over on the so called majority?  the name for leadership in africa is dictatorship while in brazil a dark skinned man is murdered every twenty three minutes. thinking it over, America is already great yet greatness might grow even more if allowed. I switch the fan on and turn off the thoughts turning over in my head for similar to the ever failing feminism there is no solution...Michelangelo Merisi hurled himself in vain across the brown sands of a distant beach as the ship sailed away with his paintings...White supremacy is all we've ever known except for the Korean girl  next to me with flesh that melts me everytime we touch. 

BRIM 123  awake in the hotel. middle of the night. can't find the light switch. a chainsaw hangover headache making it's way through my skull. doan and siti prolly get up like this having spent half the night convincing themselves that they are elsewhere only awake still confined.  finding the fixture i fling my penis into a peeing posture. something disconnects the chainsaw. thi houng and aishya  have never been through such a long august and september. even for myself october feels an ocean away.  it's going to be like having bacon in your pasta for the first time and wondering why you've not always had it this way.  all this news and hardly a word over semen i mean yemen yeah man the world is ending over in aden hodeida mukalla sana yemeni and no age restrictions for marriage...have you met an eight year old that is simply your slice of yes ma'am well semen i mean yemen how does it happen let me not ask for i've seen what happens when you ask too many questions or can't you hear nobody's talking not really not no more...it's nigger hunting season, oh you are being paranoid...they hate women, come on it's the intellect they dislike! a white man can't get no satisfaction, please you got trump what more can you want? as a muslim i feel only allah understands me, no we get it but we prefer blow jobs...  israel can't allow another hitler, well go right on ahead and cut off any head that peeks over the fence... pence vp 46 going o'biden got nothing on me too bad i can't unkaren myself here in cartagena boy oh boy all the secret service people got nothing to say about these whores except right and tight what's that honey yes yes the art therapists i can't wait...as for me, i got my jethro tull record and for my money there is no other flute in all rock and roll music save for ian anderson.  

brim 124 Having left America, inky directed his steps towards korea, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at busan. He then fixed his residence in the house of a hotel; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of recent news upon his cell phone that apparently, ashamed of not being an iphone of freemen only before google slaves, had hidden it beneath the sheltering pillows. Under the same roof as himself, existed that being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to  spray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls.  oh polidori you are going to get me in deep shit. As she danced against his dick, or tripped along the ball's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of guam. The light of music and love often accompanied inky in his search after tits and truth, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a led zeppelin butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced bed, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the writer, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in the press. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded critic-rooms and stifling politics. Whilst he wrote those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his penis, in pulsing the senses of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open legs, would say, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she wished to view in her backyard; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of certain films. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of inky; and often as she told him the tale of the movie, which had passed years amidst coats and ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely viewer to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his celluloid would run cold, whilst it attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Iove cited to him the names of even older movies, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiendish appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these movies, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of documentaries; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of  tabu a story of the south seas the thought of which brought him again to howard hughes' macau and the starting notes of this work in progress, thank ye john william. Not just you, everybody. Everybody's lonely and worried and sorry. Everybody's looking for something

82/86....brim yOU have seen how easily we can infiltrate even the inner sanctum of your headquarters yES, but even with self destructive suicide squads i mean that's great for a few high level individuals but what i was asking about was this population problem it's nearing eight billion and where the hell are we gonna put place eight million people on this planet? my idea was to kill the people and save the animals...you folks waited too long you wavered, for my part i have proposed mass extermination if the form everyday household products and i tell every jesus freak that crosses my path if you love this heaven idea so much why not go now why wait oh i see you ain't exactly sure hmm...well it's one reason to admire isis at least them muslims got no hesitation when it comes to blowing themselves up but its so messy and offers no consideration to us tourists...in Any cASE there needs to me some sort of plan not to mention lifespans are increasing even with the infomercials...that birth in malaysia was a hundred and twenty one years old...maybe we should start with people named tony i know it's a girls name as in toni but what the hell one less basil...all i know is if something does not do gown and soon, we will be forced to place limits on child birthing...the chinese have done this, but only on the surface  as there are one point three maybe four billion of them everywhere it was like reverse psyhology hell even harold adopted a girl sure a firecracker in school might go to the senate yet you see my point now the important aspect of all this is to retain the culture and identity within each country as much as possible even as we exterminate...we might get lucky...otherwise the world will be asian not that i'm against an aryan-asian society but i do feel uneasy for the nappy headed hoes, a lot of their men only want the white meat and even with the rising numbers they are basically eliminating themselves...no no i saw that but arkansas well what was that eight but nobody gets the money the state spent over years to secure those scumbags...it's thirty thousand dollars at least a year for every jail hound but that might be sixty in some cases even over a hundred and i have classmates from yale that don't even make twenty a year...turn that in your head, yale graduates making less than career criminals!

83/87 BRIM
How are you, money? said the nappy headed hoe, giving her hand to the purse she loved. It is strange to see you in these days.
The strangeness, hoe, comes from no fault of my own. Few dollars, I dare fancy, are more constant to their purses than I am. You see here it is all about currency, I say.
My business is where i lay, mostly out, about the town. replied the hoe.
Have you been about political business now, inky man? asked the corpse.
Do not ask forward questions, kim jong nam, said the ink man. the nappy headed hoe, I fear, teaches you to forget that you are although not buried still dead.
Do not scold her, said the old corpse. She is a good black girl.
It is you that forgets that i is making that pecker hard for my purse said the hoe. I do not want to be a nappy headed woman no more and after this i am going to relax my hair like they likes it back in my hood.
I don't mind waiting ever so long for you but consider that a dead man can only ejaculate so many times so do hurry with your nappy head for i am to be  married to that korean and he will still be a corpse.


84/88...BRIM...Across the lawn's field in front of the old farmhouse, the magician raced. Breathing without thought yet taking in the air from the surrounding  universe he ran. In an instant, as the tied horses now well behind him fed off the high grass, there was a flutter and instead of merlin a falcon flashed over the tranquil blue water of the lake which fenced those grounds from the forest beyond. His flight's intention would cross time. He had only met the inkrealm once before in a dream where poets danced and oxen blood was poured in with the wine. It had been easier then, the world not yet so crowded with transmission waves and his message delivered in time.

The inkrealm sat, pondering over his manuscript and pushing away into an escape from the sordid distractions. There was now more than one woman he wanted to marry and he feared there'd not be enough negro girls left when he finally came around to having a full sounding back up trio...Not that he felt his own back up singers were lacking, on the contrary... it was only for a certain track he had thought about, but there was something weird in the air as when one reaches for a libation only to knock it over before quenching the thirst...Always at times such as this, he thought of Doan and Siti and hoped they were not in too much sorrow. As lonesome as our towns have become, none of us understands truly what it is to be locked up, to have lost freedom, unless we have been in that sort of situation or in the underground metro. 

Merlin as a falcon landed in Ohio before the start of the twentieth century instead of Busan in the present. The lush valley of trees which he considered sacred were being swept away to make space for cities and he wept at the magnificent struggle which made man the owner of those lands. His message to inkrealm would have to wait just like the hearing postponed for in his dejection as a bird he turned into a native. An iroqouis which is the name their foes supplied and to which the french added the suffix and so really a mohawk yet some words stick even without the glue of logic. The mohawks and merlin moved north away from the machinery with their sadness now entwined. 

Meanwhile, inkrealm wondered if it would be wiser to wait before attempting more notes for the rest of the month.

BRIM 206 --- Life, given any sort of chance, will insist.  Luck, it seems, was neither with Doan Thi Huong or Siti Aisyah, within those February days.  They'd been working odd jobs to make ends  meet for themselves and for their family members over in Vietnam and Indonesia. 

Luxury, more often than not, is taken for granted. A given. A grain in the sands of an expansive resort. One piece in the jigsaw puzzle of some expensive lifestyle...something not readily available to most of the women in Hanoi or Sumatra along with most places on planet earth.

As I sit attempting to type and cursing the surrounding noises that haunt the evening from the careless day's screeching while enjoying American menthol cigarettes and German purity law beer, it hardly crosses my mind that many of those same women are up for sale...retail as well as the extended contract of so-called marriage. In other places you will hear DTH or SA defined as ladies of pleasure or worse yet the fact cannot be argued that many if not most marriages are based on some sort of financial agreement...Goats, gold, goulash and let us include a lack of gossip in some places are often a pre-requisite.  The statements are not intended to defend their morality or to attack the ancient institution of a union between a man and a woman. Not at all, only to underline how it is not only more than possible to be oblivious to hmm let us call it slavery for sake of ease while we enjoy this or that indulgence. 

Enough prelude. I point here to position the query - having recently enumerated several articles which all lead to a reasonable doubt in their involvement and intent in terms of the alleged murder of kim jong nam or as the court has opted to call him; kim chol - and that is how in the name of any logic did the officers in kuala lumpur track down these two women with hours of the incident?
One could safely imagine that at least dozens, perhaps hundreds passed through the area in question at klia two at about the same time. One could also postulate that if a judge requires twelve days to contemplate the cctv video should not the investigation/investigators needed a bit more time to conclude with certainty that these in fact were suspects. I feel confident that they and maybe even others will point to the LOL apparel yet consider that they would have had to guess from a long list of recent arrivals and without an eyewitness saying sure that is Doan and that Siti. No airport employee, no taxi driver fingered them. It was? what, a remarkable perhaps historical piece of detective work? 

Now then, given what is known about the enforcement agencies in malaysia, this appears highly unlikely. Take for example the graft of millions which is actually not being handled by this crack team of investigators but an international body...In most places, one would need a warrant to walk through somebody's locked door. In this case, nothing has been said or written of that type of order only that indeed they found the suspects and proceeded to interrogate them for hours without legal representation - in itself a reason to suspend any sort of fair proceeding trial -  then locked them up to wait with a series of date changes the most recent being the current delay to the sixth of november.  

A writer, even in ths modern day internet everybody typing era, given any sort of a chance will write.  In trying to right this situation, these circumstances, I find that what is mentioned here should not have been overlooked. Often, in trying to find or fight for a new path to pave upon the page, the pen will play to itself without regard to what might have been axiomatic. The diffidence that faltered, the not done...Yet, now it is dressed for the audience that appreciates logic and the balanced process of the law. I suppose the courts in kuala lumpur should be among that crowd...

Alike life, I insist, there should be release and freedom for Doan Thi Huong and Siti Aisyah and not only that but also compensation for all the calamity which this detainment, arrest, captivity, and trial by media has caused them and their loved ones. 








brim 213. Upon realizing the multiple variety of pricey sneaker wearing, bearded, flabby muscled chubby mulatto mongrels available in Manhattan while filming her latest feature, and how many of them were willing to stand in not only for the weekend but the working weekdays as well not to mention the wickedly absurd mix up with the drummer during a post concert rendevouz, selena allowed the fading cardboard cut out teeny bopper to court her all over again as the international hoi polloi press regurgitated their stickings and wheelings...

As much as i wanted to be happy for her, not to mention the white supremacist who told me well it's one less thing to worry about as i declined his offer to stay for lunch, i could not help a feeling of astonishment at the amount of media dedicated to them as opposed to the lack of pictures, court sketches, video reports, and actual journalistic investigation...uhm questions, you know, in the twelve day awaited return of the trial after the judge had supposedly weighed the cctv information.

Minutes and hours passed and soon it became evident that there would be no images from the trial on the sixth of november...Once again it was the let me keep the money cop and his evaluation of airport security video...Arguments and accusations that are easily dismantled by only a fraction of critical thinking...

It reminded me of the time one of the neighbors thought i was climbing up the back stairs and fornicating with one or maybe two of those girls. Well, I soon found a globe lock on that door and still LOL at the lengths some people will go to when they are opposed to even the possibility of someone else's pleasure...

The pleasure here would be a mistrial, but powers that pretend to be are breathing in and out huffing and puffing all about these suspects and now maybe they are five and oh those two were unidentified north korean officials...as if i mean having actually stated unidentified well it is the same as a guess, an estimation based on dead pixel reckoning...in fact, it matters not since it seems there is no way they are going to release these women and send out the proverbial posse for those men indeed not even the identified ones and so i dare to ask what is the point?

Along this same rationale, what is the point of the live feed? the awaiting audience was fed nothing more than repetitious scraps...Let me take a wild shot, najib and co are waiting for EVERYONE to join in the conga line and dance the oh me oh my limbo and then everything can go back to rigged elections...mcDonalds Broadcom and the music of perfecting a substitute for bacon? 

I'm starting to feel like the last man standing and when will i join your bullshit ways and hand over my pens and pencils well in the words of heston when you pry them from my cold dead hands.


brim - 128

we are chasing bits of news / this work in progress gives proof that the symptoms extends to poets. some people are even fighting statues...the sculpure war...the south is losing the battle again as a matter of record sure old soldiers never die yet doesn't it feel silly...indeed like rationed sperm...
the american wet dream, murdered by a screaming intolerance...moms and dads microwave blender tv...we are chasing fragments of fame, all the children still insane jim no freedom of pain; here's your pill along with the doctor's bill. 



brim 214 at the end of tarnished lady the milionaire had to settle for a baby instead of his long envisioned dream of a high rise...i dreamt awaiting for sliding train doors to release me from the riding...broadway line, i suppose, where part of my literary inclination started or is that stopped...awake...the middle of the afternoon, miami, i did surmise still unable to find my way back to sweden from my sojourn in the tropics...they say tallulah bankhead could not go six months without a man...i wanted to moscow or even sochi yet i had to figure out where i was...the portable steinbeck i pondered if they had tried to sixteen coaches long me wrong me airport me apartment me hell if the baby could be a building i might be to borrow from twin peaks a whole damn town or is that damned town...my city was gone and i took a beer and then another until i turned to see farah ottolux in competition with a corpulent botero sculture...it wasn't that she was heavy preggers by now no it was the necklace again...with hotel ice cubes in the shape of commercial mints i rubbed her stretched flesh and waited for each one to melt...those magical rivers cascading down that skin...dissolving poetry, dethawing sketches...she was a sky and those were clouds...mesmerized i could hardly emotion for sexual pleasures even if here and there i did help myself to a lick or even to a lip quenching kiss...i dared not ask if the child was from my supply of human seed or even if it was michael's sperm since i only wanted to enjoy the love sensation available to us from the blow out door busting super sale of the romance store...soon enough midnight was upon us...i will go now for drugs and drink, perhaps we will meet again before the pain of creation overwhelms you into aha in two...


the night was not florida keys and in the distance the ramones tape traveled through the speakers...i looked at the words:

it was noon time in kuala lumpur and i was done with patience in terms of the trial but patience would yet have its way with me and my time. I had to part ways with the horse team i had rode in on...frances was always cooking and i was not a big eater...james and i disagreed extensively over several points not to mention if he'd actually run for congress...harry had been photographed with forty four although i could sort of make out a message i could not take any chances especially not now with paradise papers pointing even into buckingham...and ann well, i sensed she could not exactly take a stand on issues regarding weight and i desperately wanted to have a leaner, trimmer, society...the flat belly monster she called me...oh well, i suppose it had been a good ride and wished everyone well as i saddled up my wagon to cross the plains into the finish line of this trial. murder they say in that impossible tone...wrap it up...perhaps let us look at it this way; no news is good news...still that much trial foreplay with two month turnovers and twelve days waiting you'd expect there'd be some sex justice orgasm by now but no it's nothing but more cautious creeping by a corrupt government that has somehow paid for a certain style of press coverage which an internet search will reveal to be horrifyingly uniform in terms of opinion. does reuters say purple well then we will all say that too or no make it violet so it won't be so obvious...i swear it is true not even in learned circles will you ever hear such unvarying variations i mean it might be so with shakespeare yet it is not, not by any stretch of the imagination.  owl... cricket... i'll crimson where nobody's red.  


BRIM 207
in order to be prepared to view the new blade runner i watched the old one and yes i still don't like that film...not for slowness, not for neo-noir, not for style instead the insisting ads and the protagonist always being saved by the proverbial bell...what the hell, i rested and heard the messages roll in...well africa has every right to use all the colored american folks they can to payback slavery...save me from these arguments...no, all right the other side yeah but you people sold yourselves out...omg, there's no end to it...i duck and head to the library singing we are the world we are the childrens...the new kennedy info...in a glance it tells me the kgb thought it was lbj while the cia is posting puppy pictures and making the president hold back some print...another message, james is a double agent working for the democrats nobody puts that much effort into propaganda unless they want the opposite effect...for every action there is an equal and contrary reaction, i have heard so perhaps parts of the united dodgers and astros are chained by african forces...i start back examing the earlier position since i am in fact considering the campaign manager position for the congressional run...i suppose no, it's only intensity...the terminator of the internet...in all this, later, i contemplate that very few people mention white slavery...i know some actors will be able to relate to this line of thinking...type casting, stereotyping...sheryl's poem speaks volumes...i dreamt of laura palmer...it was as if we were somehow of the same mind where our actions hardly ever felt to disturb the space surrounding us...you know the type of ease i mean where there is no worry or hurry it's only she and me without a scheme...i wake up and forget...yet like many dreams it's there waiting for those few seconds of tranquility to bring it all back home and indeed returning to bed it comes back to me right before i see berlin syndrome...a shocker of a scene especially in contrast to my casual dream...i spend most of the picture trying to tell the locked in girl to fill the bathtub with water and set the place on fire right before the kidnapper's arrival but no dice...well, i guess that is why i didn't write that show...it would have been fifteen minutes long...one day me and sofia will make a two hour picture but not today...so where are the other thoughts hovering over this one idea...ah yes pook is not here...oh no book is nonsense to some...wait, it is going to get worse...in the land, inspired by jfk conspiracy theories, of way out there stretch limo waiting for prom season i say to myself well inky what if it is only something centered around the opposite, two men poisoning a woman...what woman..not sure, where did the aliens land? the garden state...a mirror image of something past maybe even future...few sure....is this the story of johnny rotten HRC...trump and pence in a tag team match yet her running mate was high on harmonica and lo and behold maybe well what i did like was like tears lost in the falling rain.

BRIM 208 so this is my new fic!!! the fic will help me meet my expectations of a new paragraph!!! this was inspired by high times and code also my best friend and soulmate 4 life is helping me with this fic so yay!!! someone has sex but not really so don't leave me!!! hope you like reading it as much as i enjoy writing it!!!

BRIM 75 or 79 as with many things or even anything, in writing it's good to strike while the iron is hot as the cliche tells us however in weighing my position i postulated that a week away from typing would serve some purpose perhaps even give me new inspiration the problem is that people like to speculate and within that never ending curiousity there is the corruption which follows it...that is why there is that other cliche which killed the cat...in any case, here we are back at notes...i feel whatever this pause provoked that it was well placed given that gina spent the same week on stage as curly's wife in of mice and men a pretty good story to ponder early in life as it tends to put-place you more on the side of compassion or empathy....i had to leave busan for a few minutes in miami where cheerleading gladiators are being thrown to the lions as we speak...of course, i went right back to south korea after a stop in the city where evil forces are attempting to move my apartment to another floor...this happens there or at least i've seen it happen twice before but my feeling is that it is highly unfair and most likely unjustified...although it is present in my thoughts the scene has no real place in this manuscript. as i think now to let paragraphs pour down into the page to edit later it occurs to me that words come before any rational thought at least in humans...i suppose this is how words get their power or some of it...as i lay next to jyong mesmerized by her eyes, i started daydreaming about doan and then how thi is so near to thigh and being sunday i  am always reminded of being stopped by unsensual men in uniform posing as keepers of the peace...one of them had an automatic pistol strapped to his thigh...buenos dias he was trying to speak to me it was eight thirty in the morning...i only bring it up for the word buenos has busan in it...i wonder how many koreans are in argentina...some people fit in nicely nearly everywhere...i'm exhausted from all the sex, i have slept but it has been thinking sleep where the mind tries to resolve some equation or theory...i have slept but it has been a series of escaping dreams from the visitors that perchanced or the bad sex women of frustration and jealousy...i know this section isn't anything special yet let it be a common prayer for my friends in missouri and texas where a storm has ripped through the otherwise gentle skies. april showers bring may flowers april tempest brings mayhem and trouble. 

BRIM 76 or 80  gold in the skin and now i'm glowing i'm golden finally i get why so many bitches rub this and that on their faces not to mention virgin blood sometimes it feels like the city and having had the sit down with pink secret who told me that if i wanted to smuggle drugs into malaysia i could find a girl with flabby tits and pay off a doctor to put two packages in her and then get another one in kuala lumpur to pull it out and stitch it up with a similar size settings...i tell pink secret why are we eating bread in a fancy east side hotel restaurant and no because i have already tried hanging myself and don't want to let nobody else try it for me...hell, i'm thinking if they beat a school boy to death imagine what they would do to a writer...people are being rounded up and told to shut their pie holes, facebook accounts have disappeared, and well, maybe i'm in over my head but if anything runs in my family it is pigheadedness, they are stubborn folk some of them have lived to be a hundred and six which is nothing in contrast to 121 who was that puan the oldest bitch in malaysia expired the other day...i was with christina in san francisco but don't tell her boyfriend...even if it was only in a dream...waking up from it i heard le pen did not win outright and had competition from my corn or something and yeah corn is good food but to get real votes...stranger things can happen even the obiden grope and rope tour is making the rounds...women across several cities have been complaining of breast discomfort after their bras came into the vicinity of that circus act...to think ringling brothers gave it up and we are left with democrats...a man could puke if  a man were pre-disposed to vomit...at least walls are going up against the rising tide of immigrant hordes in europe...sad though that it comes to this but i guess it is the same reason why we all have gates and locks and doors as for the spiritual intruders well i myself have not washed the sheets this year and it gives me a good sense of place that is until the nose movers push the no smell no tell button. 

BRIM- pg 12 - And the writer--you have brought some message probably from him?
He says, Anatole France has been made and he feels awful over not having had the chance to make him out before! He says, This is not a feminist book and he has no such political stance and I quote the writer:  I am determined not to die before I can  block my wife from taking all my money! No wait, sorry that was the photojournalist. Here, Here, I really quote the writer: Sure I like women but I was raised up in the same places you were and a blonde well aren't we gentlemen supposed to prefer them and even now if i see some bitch wearing united airline leggings well there is that oh fuck what a whoring cunt goes there so it's not like I'm nobody to look up to under those political ahem social political situations but I am trying to improve from the puritan mindset no that is not even entirely true I am trying but most of the time I am trying to get through the evening in my own language and given the chance I'd have us all dressing up in muted colonial colors. Now, then, as for these accusations of racism, I don't know, it's the Americans ain't it, they continually forget that the economic inequality is the problem. I happen to have great affection for the hindus, well I like some of them, a few, I've even well I haven't really but I intend to watch a very harold and kumar 3d christmas. 

brim-pg 13 -It was late in the afternoon when the inky man got to his new cell phone. He had never seen it before, though he well knew the exact spot where it could be simed, and had often looked up at the window girl, regarding the place with the unpleasant suspicions one feels while sauntering the red district in Amsterdam; for he knew that strange women like that were now the new dangers to the property of his imagination. That had once happened with Orange, and, of course, with Wind, he believed that these corporations had obtained information by robbery and fraud. He hesitated a moment before he presented himself at her glance, having some fear of her beauty. The beautiful even more than the damned could take anyone into a detour of years away from their own intentions.  He knew
that he was doing right, but these corporations in their own profit scheme to escape another imperial invasion were
uncanny, and might be dangerously insolent. It's not that he had a determined commission which required a clandestine stance yet it irked him to have a memory imposed simply because someone accessed his storage file say from 2012 and suddenly instead of the present the inky man found himself stranded in an intruder's judgement over a png that might only have been saved to serve a whim. Besides, a new, cheap, device would be safer as well as intentionally bypassing the predators he might even untangle himself from the court of fools always free for a cut throat take it all away as soon as anything sugary might sweeten the script. 

 
BRIM-pg 14- Sylvia, you are my sister in so many ways and still what i like is the piston in motion. I got up and strangely I did not feel like taking a piss. It could be that this had been the day that Virginia Woolf put rocks in her pockets. Hid blotting woman emotion the feeling always middle class. The stones are not the best blues band, they are the only ones left! I guess you think I'm kicking you, Bob. But it ain't so. What I'm doing is talking. You hear? I'm talking to all those villains down there in Kansas. I'm talking to all those villains in Missouri and all those villains down there in Cheyenne. And what I'm saying is there ain't no whore's gold! And if there was they wouldn't want to come looking for it anyhow!

You can look dirty, but you can’t be dirty. I have done it again! 

BRIM 200 To make it new, day by day...wednesday 25 october...twenty 17. Middle of the Asian evening, I'm exhausted. When you take these chances, even in a work in progress, well it makes for a strange worry. Misunderstandings, missed landings...My aircraft hovered over some speech by el or al sisi and all I saw was makeup as he stood next to the french president who somehow was not as glossy. Now, being that it is only a prelude or introduction to serve as opening for the paragraph I could ask myself; should I edit that out and away...But the lipstick, it was well runaway train...and you're gonna clean that spot until it gets that shiny clean...Some cook, some do not cook...I heated up the poultry, scraped the rice out of the pot, and cut through a tomato. I ate yet there is hunger. I slept yet i longed for a nap. Ask the egyptians on the street...who are these people and where is Hosni and where is de Gaulle...I was going to speak of the visit to the airport which I may have wrongly reported in these notes as having already transpired ofcourse not with any deceptive intention...It was what had been revealed in numerous respectable journals, if memory serves, right after the lab visit and the announcement of the live feed.  I should also note that this is not to indicate that the intention of all these notes is veracity or adherence to non-fiction. As might be more than evident, there is a goodly amount of well flights of fancy if you will and the poetry i cannot help but spill or stream of beatnik thrills...Now let me see if the sour hordes will let me get through a few lines before i become entirely who or what i didn't intend to be all for the sake of envy or perceived bliss which makes no sense yet some are confident that indeed they have every right to glue my nose and glom my natural tranquility...more on that later, if the circumstances continue yet let us as ee suggested further into now. 

BRIM 201 we don't need lawyers, we will enshrine the thought...oh shit he got hour send the night xi masturbates to his collected pictures of ivanka...speak in secret alphabet...all a jew wants to do is doodle a christian girl...it was a trilogy i don't know how he got away with it...i'm thinking this will be, after all is said and done the second tome of a modern day trilogy...learn to forget...all you need to know about a writer is right there at the end of the usual suspects...and sex, well it was good i might not ever need to have it again...i am silently correcting your grammar...two grams could make at least eight lines...a combination of chinks with dutch cohorts, holland...hand lol...are these the words of the all powerful boards syndicates cartels...we've dropped a fortune into this man kim jong nam and he's looking less like the future leader of north korea than ever before whaddaya say we take him out and then have a party in senegal you know you could choke a child for some spare change in dakar...in the car, not the car, dakar!  da russians say this is an iffy theory and to see german arms reaching up through air again well as a girl from bavaria i must confess it gives me mixed emotions sure i voted for the afd but as i sat watching the report well it made me happy that merkel isn't entirely out of the scene...tank wank I sank into a documentary on the election entitled the babysitter...after a dream confrontation wherein i tell the man no, sir, this is my house. here i come to save the day that means that mighty mouse is on the way... i could relate to the babysitter because i always carried respect for the clinton team but then she went in with the opposition...i'd rather get hit by a car...there's a picture of my pregnant mother when the closet came down on her arm and i'm fooling around with a lollipop. it was back in the apartment with walls so thin that one time in trying to smack down a roach the heel of the striking shoe punctured the greasy wallpaper revealing the hollow crevice which held the abode together...shoot em in the titties...rudy k said words are like drugs......i suppose it is why i enjoy writing literature...now i'm not certain an xray will provide enough security, i mean there could be something in the teeth...but it's a puppy who would sink so low as to implant a device in the chompers...cannot take chances..in our country anything is possible, stop the putin bromance and discontinue contradicting the criminality of kim jong un...the dj spins michael jackson's dangerous...faces melt in your mind...indiana jones nazi...well, some people enjoy chaos, it don't matter if your black or white but boy you are looking a lighter shade of pale better eat something, anything...emperor dog deep dish...start where you are...procol harem...pale face want to see rain dance...no no sixteen vestal virgins...i didn't inhale a line from f-troop...peace pipe train...call you up in the middle of the night a little out of touch a little insane...sure i will set back and stop to edit as soon as they let my doan and siti go! 

BRIM 202  i didnt want to follow the findings as they fingered the internet crotch..not that i'm against foreplay but this connection to cell phones and apps well it once in a while disconects you from reality not that we can use that word so much now given the television...which reminds me a note on the yellow...wroted way before the priceless ads but after the price is right...another word to avoid for the foreseeable future yet somewhere all the words will be reclaimed...i started with precious yet i have not entirely succeeded in freeing it from film title slavery...slav slaw slay sleaze...they call me the breeze...brethren malay club bouncers of the future stood surrounding the kuala lumpur airport...travelers thought they were in a star wars movie...i find your lack of faith disturbing...maybe you have not worn a bullet proof vest but surely you've been to a dentist at least if you are lucky enough to live outside of the states or england and so you know how heavy those covers are when you get an xray...so no stretch to imagine walking around with that would be a bitch...not to mention knowing you are that close to an airplane getaway yet grounded by handcuffs...tore down is a great blues song...almost level to the ground well i feel like this when my ticket to indonesia or vietnam can't be found...bring out the movable chairs with big wheels...carry me home to see my ask me counter and bibik heritage cafe...the ass oh sated press deleted the re-enactment statements...some assholes tried to turn my hotel room quarters in a departure area...i read the words chaotic and closely watched...i thought of britney spears, oops they did it again this time a weird type of alliteration...flanked, frenzy, flurry...wtf...fly ball flux where does it go emily says nobody knows formaldehyde won't make the same headline as vx mace macedonia you go slay wake up and slay no i meant to f-troop...the table is formica...form of address for the inky man why dear or darling of course the founding father of lunatic fringe...frau fraud no if we freebase it will be gone a lot faster...fire hose free for all was a form of poetry finding words stance wordstance,why that is nearly as good as worddust...maybe they thought to themselves what if this is as good as it gets...a different show, yes, but i still want to say how wow i was to have said hey to wrangler jane...ahem...freshwater fish fresno frozen yogurt madison avenue flute strife fig tree fried eggs i didn't want to finger the findings as they internet - the new hindrance failed, ..find fund fast enhanced...that rain often departed...the rain is part of the process john the babtist franz burning down the house the fireman on twin peaks saying you are far away...

BRIM-pg 11-if you look up, or -as we often tend to now intone- google how to follow satan it won't bring you satisfaction unless you intend to worship the devil. What I was searching for was how to follow the lightning quick trilogy that is turning out to be page ten of this tome. i suppose some exposition on the reason for this "style" might be in order. it is three fold, more than once i have felt that not only was a certain work in progress already available but even some of the thoughts behind it and so why not post it as it were...secondly, the challenge of being concise while at the same time throwing nearly all manner of form out the window and -hopefuly- making it new or at least beatific in that smoke for the scene and bring everybody into the dream type of typing wherein a quote such as just sped by your reading peepers will melt into the question, into the quest...third and lastly, this "act" this craft, this spooky art, it is part of what makes me who i am even when i say some immortal words not mine or sing a line far from this time. It makes it so because that is also who we all are, the collective 'we all' so when the cult croons i fell from the sky well we have all had that dream, no? Yes and so we can get on the bandstand it's a good a good beat and you can dance to it understand? I like that tradition, what James Joyce, TS Eliot, Ezra Pound, ee Cummings, and William Burroughs brought to literature. Now then, how to follow Lucifer as it were... I may have mentioned in these notes how goodly Rules Don't Apply looked and in one of my favorite scenes Howard Hughes, by the way that book by Richard Hack could give the Harry Houdini pamphlet a run for its money if you enjoy an awesome story, takes a plane over to Great Britain and on the way he's telling the story of Jolson having to come on stage after Caruso. Well, Jolson struggles since the crowd keeps cheering uhm you know like when the fab four had to quit touring because they simply could not hear themselves over the euphoric screams, anyway he gets them, HH, relates, to simmer down and then proclaims, you ain't seen nothing yet. Cutting off the engine and letting the air freighter float with the back door flapping he starts on a solo jamboree of Is it True What They Say About Dixie even throwing in a few extra lines just like Bob Dylan might in a concert well in a concert in a city with his kind of light. Right. Now, then, there this is what I need to do here even if it seems I only have Hathaway in euphoria as Billy Shakes put-placed it  I hate  from hate away she threw and saved my life saying not you. I realize, it might only be my own reverie and in reality her and Eiza have teamed up to put me a straitjacket yet that is all one really needs indeed that dream those dreamy feelings of being appreciated. i don't expect anyone to applaud at this point especially when in other circumstances i would be pretty much through given that it's been a month but they are dragging this out like Talia on a what to wear for the weekend over on the west coast...there's even graffiti going, how much longer?  Call from Cairo! telephone? an actual - yes. Who, I ask one of my two secretaries, he's saying Honey. Honey? I'm not here, I don't know any honey well wait hand me the handset, Hello? Inky Man it's Hosni Hi! Mubarak, you motherfucker, I heard you were free nobody said you got a cell. I am calling because I need this talk of release orgy contained. Look, man you were uhm I was happy for you I let it go, nobody reads these things i see you still sound like mister dracula. I am going to be very fair with you Inky Man, I only ask not to be included in the final draft. We can talk it over, I would love to visit egypt a lot of the cabbies in the city they only pick me up because they think i'm from the luxor oh wait you know i could sell my agent on a biography but with the sex you know how it is in the publishing business.. No biography not yet only i need containment yes? In that case, let's have a meeting, a sit down i really need to get out of the house more anyway and i know you can relate. Very nice talking, I will think for a time to meet and meanwhile remember my request.  you got it big dog, falafel and castello high red label beer i hope soon thanks for checking in, sorry about the piece in the times. Inky Man you read my mind, those faggots they don't know what's it like in egypt with  emergency law and everybody wanting more money everywhere nevermind I change my stance write the whole orgy yes and i say to you as a friend in a few more days there will be more. Well, that makes my job a lot easier, i hear the GID is no joke and well don't get too wild. I have always been a moderate despite what they might say and yes no joke but it is GIS at least for now. all right, got it,  give my regards to Saliba Street!
