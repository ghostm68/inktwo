                        Julia Garner is interested in beauty. In love. In bringing a sense of careâ€”of heart and soulâ€”to her roles and to all of the films she's involved in. This sounds like it should be a given, considering the demands of being an actor in today's world, fully submitting yourself to a character and filming in far-flung locations over weeks at a time. It requires a love of the craft, but also a sacrifice: "I'm going to be pausing my life..." she says over the phone from her home in Los Angeles, between bouts of filming The Altruists. "So I'm not saying 'yes' to everything. The people involved are really important to me because it's not just energy, it's time."
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        When Garner read the script for Weapons, the buzzy mystery horror directed by Zach Cregger, she knew instantly that she wanted to work on the project. Quite literally moving mountains by shifting her production schedule for Wolfman, to star as the divisive lead Justine Gandy. These are not the only films starring Julia Garner this year, she also plays the shimmering Silver Surfer in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, but somehow finds balance between it all. Just as long as she has had her morning coffee.

                    <p>JULIA GARNER: It's good. My coffee machine is just not working because I'm never home, so I had to go downstairs quickly and get a coffee. I'm not a real person without coffee, even a sip, so apologies for being 10 minutes late. I've been in Vancouver since June. We have until December to film this show, [The Altruists]. It's been really great, but tough. There's a lot of physical obstacles, believe it or not. I'm wearing a prosthetic nose, fake teeth, and I'm acting in colored contacts, which are drier than normal lenses. And it has to cover my whole eye, because I have brown eyes in this, so it's like I'm acting with sunglasses on all day. So it's been an interesting experience. I don't want to give too much away, but you think it's just about tech, but it's not. It's a love story. That's initially what interested me.</p>

                    <p class="interview-question">ND: You've had a big summer promoting both Fantastic Four and Weapons. How is it feeling to see these films finally in theaters?</p>

                    <p>JG: I mean, it's crazy. I am in disbelief. For me, at least, you make these films, and you're in your own world and bubble with these people. I'm putting care and attention [into it] knowing that people are going to see it, but I always forget that a mass amount of people are going to see it. That feeling is super important. I've been on shows before where it was a hot project, the award project. And it didn't do anything, didn't move the needle. But Ozark, for example, season one got the perfect amount of attention. People were excited enough to invest in it, but also, nobody knew. I don't think anybody knew that that was gonna be the outcome of that show during that time of television. That was the peak of TV; the TV shows were incredible then.</p>

                    <p class="interview-question">ND: I'm sure that intimacy on set, that closeness, contributes in some way too.</p>

                    <p>JG: Yeah, well you have this sense of passion and care for one another. Everybody's pushing each other in a positive way, and even if someone's pushing someone in a hard wayâ€”I think it's so corny, but love is the most important thing with everything, real love for what you're doing and who you're with.</p>

                    <p class="interview-question">ND: It's amazing that one of these films is a big Marvel project, and Weaponsâ€”there's been so much buzz around that project, that's been really exciting.</p>

                    <p>JG: I read Weapons and I knew it was special. I was in the middle of doing Wolfman, I got the script and they were about to shoot soon. I was in production and there was a chance that the scheduling wasn't going to work. I was like, I'm going to call Zach [Cregger] and tell him that I'm doing this because I'm doing this. So, bless my agent and Miri Yoon, who's the producer, they made it work out.</p>

                    <p class="interview-question">ND: What was it about the role of Justine that you were most interested in?</p>

                    <p>JG: It was her arc. I found it very interesting that people were judging her initially. They thought she was the bad person. She is a person that's lying to herself constantly, so people can pick up on that energy and they think that she is lying about the situation, but really, she's lying about who she is. She is very messy. I had a whole backstory: she probably was a certain way when she was younger and she's trying to reinvent herself to be this perfect a-type personality. But she's not at all. She's impulsive. She's a functioning alcoholic.</p>

                    <p class="interview-question">ND: In another interview, you said that when you prepare for a role, you prep to the point where you can feel it in your bones. How did you go about becoming Justine?</p>

                    <p>JG: It was a crazy process. I had such short prep time with it because I was on Wolfman. Once I was done with my big, intense scenes, I started prepping for Weapons. The first thing for me is, I journal. I journal a lot about different relationships, just different things that are coming up. Then I do a meditation. Weird things can inspire me, like for some reason I was so keen on her wearing glasses. Another thing that really inspires me is people watching. lf you just go on the street, you see how somebody is talking on the phoneâ€”they might hold the phone weird. You see somebody's walk, or the walks of people you know. I'm always just interested in real people. Unless I'm playing Patrick Bateman or something, I don't need perfect posture. I think that perfection is going to be a result of imperfection.</p>

                    <p class="interview-question">ND: Looking back, is there a specific role that had a profound impact on you or changed the way that you see the world?</p>

                    <p>JG: There's definitely movies that changed my brain. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a movie that I remember watching for the first time when I was young, and I could not believe that somebody could tell a story like that. It was so heady, but so emotional at the same time. I was in awe of that. For roles, A Woman Under the Influence. I've spoken about All About Eve before. Isabelle Huppert in The Piano Teacher. I love that performance. You sometimes watch things and you're like, 'Wow, they've captured a moment.' Like, for that actor, it was real. They got it on film, they captured it. The editor and the director were smart enough to take that cut and put it in the film for people to feel less alone. That's what I love about movies. It's a room, and it's art, and it's storytelling. It's just a reminder, especially in this day and age, that art brings people together. Politics separate people.</p>
